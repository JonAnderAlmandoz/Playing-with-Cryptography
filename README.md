# Cryptography Playground

Welcome to the Cryptography Playground! This repository is my personal sandbox for diving into the intricate and fascinating world of cryptography. Inspired by the comprehensive Cryptography Tutorial by Geeks for Geeks, this project aims to explore various cryptographic concepts, algorithms, and their practical applications.

## About

Cryptography is the art of secure communication in the presence of third parties. It involves creating written or generated codes that allow information to be kept secret. Cryptography not only protects data from theft or alteration but also can be used for user authentication.

In this repository, you will find implementations, experiments, and notes covering a wide range of topics from basic ciphers to advanced encryption standards. Whether you are a seasoned cryptographer or just starting, there's something here for everyone interested in the art of secret communication.

## What's Inside

- **Basic Ciphers:** Delve into historical ciphers like Caesar, Vigenère, and more. Understand their mechanisms and why they could be cracked.
- **Modern Cryptography:** Explore the workings of symmetric and asymmetric encryption methods including AES, RSA, and ECC.
- **Cryptographic Protocols:** Examine protocols that ensure secure communication, such as SSL/TLS, SSH, and more.
- **Hands-On Challenges:** Test your skills with real-world cryptographic challenges.
- **Resources & References:** Curated list of books, articles, and online resources to deepen your understanding of cryptography.
